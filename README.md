CRUD operation on Employee Management System
I have developed an Employee Management System structured on a three-layer architecture. This comprehensive system includes the presentation layer, service layer, and repository layer, facilitating efficient management of employee data. The tech stack employed encompasses Java, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, and Postman for testing and validation. The system is designed to streamline operations and enhance the overall management of employee information.
